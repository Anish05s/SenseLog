# 🧠 SenseLog

**SenseLog** is an IoT-based system that gives physical objects **memory and awareness** using Arduino and a Python-powered dashboard.

It tracks how objects are used in real-time, logs interactions, and visualizes behavior — bridging the gap between the physical and digital world.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📦 Detects object pickup and placement using sensors
* 🧠 Logs interaction events with timestamps
* 📊 Real-time dashboard for monitoring usage
* 📡 ESP32-CAM live video integration
* ⚡ Lightweight and runs locally (no cloud required)

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
Arduino → Serial Communication → Python Logger → CSV Storage → Dashboard Visualization
                                               → (Future) Flask Web App
```

1. Arduino detects object interaction
2. Sends event data via serial (USB)
3. Python logger records data into CSV
4. Dashboard reads CSV and displays insights
5. ESP32 streams live video feed
